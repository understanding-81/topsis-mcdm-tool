## What is TOPSIS?

**TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)** is a widely used  
**Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM)** method.

It ranks alternatives based on:
- Minimum distance from the **ideal best** solution
- Maximum distance from the **ideal worst** solution

### Applications
- Product and model comparison  
- Engineering decision making  
- Supplier selection  
- Business analytics  
- Decision support systems

## Features

### Web Application
- Upload CSV file containing alternatives and criteria
- **Sample input dataset available** for instant testing
- Faded example placeholders for:
  - Weights: `e.g. 1,2,3,4`
  - Impacts: `e.g. +,+,-,+`
- Automatic computation of:
  - Normalized decision matrix
  - Weighted normalized matrix
  - Ideal best and worst solutions
  - TOPSIS score
  - Final ranking
- Results displayed in a clean table
- Optional **email delivery of results**
- Responsive and user-friendly UI

### Python CLI Tool
- Lightweight and easy to use
- Supports CSV and Excel files
- Automatic input validation
- Generates ranked output file

## Web App Usage

1. Upload a CSV file or download the sample dataset
2. Enter weights (comma-separated numeric values)
3. Enter impacts (+ for benefit, - for cost)
4. (Optional) Enable "Send result to email"
5. Click "Calculate TOPSIS"
6. View TOPSIS scores and rankings instantly

## Python Package Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher

### Install from PyPI
```bash
pip install topsis-decision-analysis
```

### Local Installation
```bash
pip install .
```

---

## Command Line Usage
```bash
topsis <inputFile> <weights> <impacts> <outputFile>
```

### Example
```bash
topsis sample.csv "1,2,3,4" "+,+,-,+" result.csv
```

---

## Sample Input Format
```csv
Model,Price,Performance,Camera,Battery
A,25000,8,7,4000
B,30000,9,8,4500
C,20000,7,6,3800
```

---

## Output Columns

- **Topsis Score** – Closeness coefficient
- **Rank** – Final ranking (Rank 1 = Best)

---

## Challenges & Learnings

- Handling inconsistent CSV inputs
- Validating weights and impacts
- Email integration using environment variables
- Full-stack deployment on Render
- Publishing and maintaining a PyPI package

---

## Future Enhancements

- Graphical visualization of rankings
- Support for additional MCDM techniques (AHP, VIKOR)
- Downloadable PDF reports
- User authentication
- Dockerized deployment
